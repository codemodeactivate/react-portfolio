  ## Questions
  If you have any questions, please contact me at jeff.zenko@gmail.com. You can also find me on GitHub at [codemodeactivate](https://github.com/codemodeactivate).
  ## Future Development
  I'll probably add a blog component and server side stuff for the contact form so I don't have to use a 3rd party. Also the acceptance criteria for this project was not exactly what I would have done. I ignored some of it, but the way the form handles is really annoying to users, in my opinion.
